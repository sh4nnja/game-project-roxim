The Effectiveness of Utilizing "Vblox" with Simulation Mechanics for Learning Basic Programming among Grade 12 STEMC Students in University of Cabuyao

The researchers aim to make a game-based basic programming course with a goal of teaching students basic programming skills with an in depth application and hands-on. The game will immerse students by teaching programming in a game-like structure, which makes it fun and immersive. The researchers will test its effectiveness of such game-based learning to students and provide data accordingly.

The researchers aims to develop a game that immerse students while teaching them programming. It involves quest like lesson and materials which students can play, utilizing a block based programming mechanic, students can code by placing blocks to attain a certain task or quest to progress. Additionally, students can test their code into a virtual robot which resides in a virtual environment. By this, students can build and personalize their own robots that interacts with the environment, complete tasks or quest which in the end might teach them basic programming knowledge.
