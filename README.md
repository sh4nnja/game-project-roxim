# A virtual robotics simulator.  
Source code for roxim-vr, a capstone project made into a passion project.

It is from a previous research capstone project Vblox converted into a fresh project. The potential it brings to the table is noticeable. I am rebranding it and making sure it works much better than the previous one as the previous one is very much a prototype project. 

It is a project hoping to enable everyone to access the robotics realm without the pain in purchasing expensive parts and risk destroying it when tinkering. This simulation provides an immersive experience with a touch.
